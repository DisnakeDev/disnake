            directly instead of this method if you're sending a followup message.

        Parameters
        ----------
        content: Optional[:class:`str`]
            The content of the message to send.
        embed: :class:`Embed`
            The rich embed for the content to send. This cannot be mixed with the
            ``embeds`` parameter.
        embeds: List[:class:`Embed`]
            A list of embeds to send with the content. Must be a maximum of 10.
            This cannot be mixed with the ``embed`` parameter.
        file: :class:`File`
            The file to upload. This cannot be mixed with the ``files`` parameter.
        files: List[:class:`File`]
            A list of files to upload. Must be a maximum of 10.
            This cannot be mixed with the ``file`` parameter.
        allowed_mentions: :class:`AllowedMentions`
            Controls the mentions being processed in this message. If this is
            passed, then the object is merged with :attr:`Client.allowed_mentions <disnake.Client.allowed_mentions>`.
            The merging behaviour only overrides attributes that have been explicitly passed
            to the object, otherwise it uses the attributes set in :attr:`Client.allowed_mentions <disnake.Client.allowed_mentions>`.
            If no object is passed at all then the defaults given by :attr:`Client.allowed_mentions <disnake.Client.allowed_mentions>`
            are used instead.
        tts: :class:`bool`
            Whether the message should be sent using text-to-speech.
        view: :class:`disnake.ui.View`
            The view to send with the message. This cannot be mixed with ``components``.
        components: |components_type|
            A list of components to send with the message. This cannot be mixed with ``view``.

            .. versionadded:: 2.4

        ephemeral: :class:`bool`
            Whether the message should only be visible to the user who started the interaction.
            If a view is sent with an ephemeral message and it has no timeout set then the timeout
            is set to 15 minutes.
        suppress_embeds: :class:`bool`
            Whether to suppress embeds for the message. This hides
            all the embeds from the UI if set to ``True``.

            .. versionadded:: 2.5

        flags: :class:`MessageFlags`
            The flags to set for this message.
            Only :attr:`~MessageFlags.suppress_embeds`, :attr:`~MessageFlags.ephemeral`
            and :attr:`~MessageFlags.suppress_notifications` are supported.

            If parameters ``suppress_embeds`` or ``ephemeral`` are provided,
            they will override the corresponding setting of this ``flags`` parameter.

            .. versionadded:: 2.9

        delete_after: :class:`float`
            If provided, the number of seconds to wait in the background
            before deleting the message we just sent. If the deletion fails,
            then it is silently ignored.

        a component interaction or modal interaction (if the modal was sent in
        response to a component interaction).

        .. versionchanged:: 2.5

            Now supports editing the original message of modal interactions that started from a component.

        .. note::
            If the original message has embeds with images that were created from local files
            (using the ``file`` parameter with :meth:`Embed.set_image` or :meth:`Embed.set_thumbnail`),
            those images will be removed if the message's attachments are edited in any way
            (i.e. by setting ``file``/``files``/``attachments``, or adding an embed with local files).

        Parameters
        ----------
        content: Optional[:class:`str`]
            The new content to replace the message with. ``None`` removes the content.
        embed: Optional[:class:`Embed`]
            The new embed to replace the original with. This cannot be mixed with the
            ``embeds`` parameter.
            Could be ``None`` to remove the embed.
        embeds: List[:class:`Embed`]
            The new embeds to replace the original with. Must be a maximum of 10.
            This cannot be mixed with the ``embed`` parameter.
            To remove all embeds ``[]`` should be passed.
        file: :class:`File`
            The file to upload. This cannot be mixed with the ``files`` parameter.
            Files will be appended to the message.

            .. versionadded:: 2.2

        files: List[:class:`File`]
            A list of files to upload. This cannot be mixed with the ``file`` parameter.
            Files will be appended to the message.

            .. versionadded:: 2.2

        attachments: Optional[List[:class:`Attachment`]]
            A list of attachments to keep in the message.
            If ``[]`` or ``None`` is passed then all existing attachments are removed.
            Keeps existing attachments if not provided.

            .. versionadded:: 2.4

            .. versionchanged:: 2.5
                Supports passing ``None`` to clear attachments.

        allowed_mentions: :class:`AllowedMentions`
            Controls the mentions being processed in this message.
        view: Optional[:class:`~disnake.ui.View`]
            The updated view to update this message with. This cannot be mixed with ``components``.
            If ``None`` is passed then the view is removed.
        components: Optional[|components_type|]
            A list of components to update this message with. This cannot be mixed with ``view``.
            If ``None`` is passed then the components are removed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    type: :class:`MessageType`
        The type of message.

        A :class:`Member` that sent the message. If :attr:`channel` is a
        private channel, then it is a :class:`User` instead.
    content: :class:`str`
        The actual contents of the message.
    embeds: List[:class:`Embed`]
        A list of embeds the message has.
    channel: Union[:class:`TextChannel`, :class:`VoiceChannel`, :class:`StageChannel`, :class:`Thread`, :class:`DMChannel`, :class:`GroupChannel`, :class:`PartialMessageable`]
        The channel that the message was sent from.
        Could be a :class:`DMChannel` or :class:`GroupChannel` if it's a private message.
    reference: Optional[:class:`~disnake.MessageReference`]
        The message that this message references. This is only applicable to message replies.
    interaction: Optional[:class:`~disnake.InteractionReference`]
        The interaction that this message references.
        This exists only when the message is a response to an interaction without an existing message.

        .. versionadded:: 2.1

    mention_everyone: :class:`bool`
        Specifies if the message mentions everyone.

        .. note::

            This does not check if the ``@everyone`` or the ``@here`` text is in the message itself.
            Rather this boolean indicates if either the ``@everyone`` or the ``@here`` text is in the message
            **and** it did end up mentioning.
    mentions: List[:class:`abc.User`]
        A list of :class:`Member` that were mentioned. If the message is in a private message
        then the list will be of :class:`User` instead.

        .. warning::

            The order of the mentions list is not in any particular order so you should
            not rely on it. This is a Discord limitation, not one with the library.
    role_mentions: List[:class:`Role`]
        A list of :class:`Role` that were mentioned. If the message is in a private message
        then the list is always empty.
    id: :class:`int`
        The message ID.
    webhook_id: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The ID of the application that sent this message.
    attachments: List[:class:`Attachment`]
        A list of attachments given to a message.
    pinned: :class:`bool`
        Specifies if the message is currently pinned.
    flags: :class:`MessageFlags`
        Extra features of the message.
    reactions : List[:class:`Reaction`]
        Reactions to a message. Reactions can be either custom emoji or standard unicode emoji.
    stickers: List[:class:`StickerItem`]
        A list of sticker items given to the message.
    components: List[:class:`Component`]
        A list of components in the message.
    guild: Optional[:class:`Guild`]
        The guild that the message belongs to, if applicable.

            to remove/replace existing files.
        attachments: Optional[List[:class:`Attachment`]]
            A list of attachments to keep in the message.
            If ``[]`` or ``None`` is passed then all existing attachments are removed.
            Keeps existing attachments if not provided.

            .. versionadded:: 2.2

                Supports passing ``None`` to clear attachments.

        view: Optional[:class:`~disnake.ui.View`]
            The updated view to update this message with. This cannot be mixed with ``components``.
            If ``None`` is passed then the view is removed.
        components: Optional[|components_type|]
            A list of components to update this message with. This cannot be mixed with ``view``.
            If ``None`` is passed then the components are removed.

            .. versionadded:: 2.4

        suppress_embeds: :class:`bool`
            Whether to suppress embeds for the message. This hides
            all the embeds from the UI if set to ``True``. If set
            to ``False``, this brings the embeds back if they were
            suppressed.

            .. versionadded:: 2.7

        flags: :class:`MessageFlags`
            The new flags to set for this message. Overrides existing flags.
            Only :attr:`~MessageFlags.suppress_embeds` is supported.

            If parameter ``suppress_embeds`` is provided,
            that will override the setting of :attr:`.MessageFlags.suppress_embeds`.

            .. versionadded:: 2.9

        allowed_mentions: :class:`AllowedMentions`
            Controls the mentions being processed in this message.
            See :meth:`.abc.Messageable.send` for more information.
