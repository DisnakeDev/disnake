    This is usually represented as a drop down menu.

    In order to get the selected items that the user has chosen, use :attr:`.values`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.7

    Parameters
    ----------
    custom_id: :class:`str`
        The ID of the select menu that gets received during an interaction.
        If not given then one is generated for you.
    placeholder: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The placeholder text that is shown if nothing is selected, if any.
    min_values: :class:`int`
        The minimum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    max_values: :class:`int`
        The maximum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    disabled: :class:`bool`
        Whether the select is disabled.
    row: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The relative row this select menu belongs to. A Discord component can only have 5
        rows. By default, items are arranged automatically into those 5 rows. If you'd
        like to control the relative positioning of the row then passing an index is advised.
        For example, row=1 will show up before row=2. Defaults to ``None``, which is automatic
        ordering. The row number must be between 0 and 4 (i.e. zero indexed).

    Attributes
    ----------
    values: List[Union[:class:`~disnake.User`, :class:`.Member`, :class:`.Role`]]
        A list of users, members and/or roles that have been selected by the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls: Type[:class:`MentionableSelect`]
        The select subclass to create an instance of. If provided, the following parameters

        as the passed cls does.
    placeholder: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The placeholder text that is shown if nothing is selected, if any.
    custom_id: :class:`str`
        The ID of the select menu that gets received during an interaction.
        It is recommended not to set this parameter to prevent conflicts.
    row: Optional[:class:`int`]
