    This is usually represented as a drop down menu.

    In order to get the selected items that the user has chosen, use :attr:`.values`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.7

    Parameters
    ----------
    custom_id: :class:`str`
        The ID of the select menu that gets received during an interaction.
        If not given then one is generated for you.
    placeholder: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The placeholder text that is shown if nothing is selected, if any.
    min_values: :class:`int`
        The minimum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    max_values: :class:`int`
        The maximum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    disabled: :class:`bool`
        Whether the select is disabled.
    row: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The relative row this select menu belongs to. A Discord component can only have 5
        rows. By default, items are arranged automatically into those 5 rows. If you'd
        like to control the relative positioning of the row then passing an index is advised.
        For example, row=1 will show up before row=2. Defaults to ``None``, which is automatic
        ordering. The row number must be between 0 and 4 (i.e. zero indexed).

    Attributes
    ----------
    values: List[:class:`.Role`]
        A list of roles that have been selected by the user.

    The function being decorated should have three parameters, ``self`` representing

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls: Type[:class:`RoleSelect`]
        The select subclass to create an instance of. If provided, the following parameters
        described below do no apply. Instead, this decorator will accept the same keywords
        as the passed cls does.
    placeholder: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The placeholder text that is shown if nothing is selected, if any.
    custom_id: :class:`str`
        The ID of the select menu that gets received during an interaction.
        It is recommended not to set this parameter to prevent conflicts.
    row: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The relative row this select menu belongs to. A Discord component can only have 5
        rows. By default, items are arranged automatically into those 5 rows. If you'd

        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    max_values: :class:`int`
        The maximum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    disabled: :class:`bool`
