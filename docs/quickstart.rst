Quickstart
============

This page gives a brief introduction to the library. It assumes you have the library installed,
if you don't check the :ref:`installing` portion.

A Minimal Bot
---------------

Let's make a bot that responds to a specific message and walk you through it.

It looks something like this:

.. code-block:: python3

    import disnake

    client = disnake.Client()

    @client.event
    async def on_ready():
        print(f'We have logged in as {client.user}')

    @client.event
    async def on_message(message):
        if message.author == client.user:
            return

        if message.content.startswith('$hello'):
            await message.channel.send('Hello!')

    client.run('your token here')

Let's name this file ``example_bot.py``. Make sure not to name it ``disnake`` as that'll conflict
with the library.

There's a lot going on here, so let's walk you through it step by step.

1. The first line just imports the library, if this raises a `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError`
   then head on over to :ref:`installing` section to properly install.
2. Next, we create an instance of a :class:`Client`. This client is our connection to Discord.
3. We then use the :meth:`Client.event` decorator to register an event. This library has many events.
   Since this library is asynchronous, we do things in a "callback" style manner.

   A callback is essentially a function that is called when something happens. In our case,
   the :func:`on_ready` event is called when the bot has finished logging in and setting things
   up and the :func:`on_message` event is called when the bot has received a message.
4. Since the :func:`on_message` event triggers for *every* message received, we have to make
   sure that we ignore messages from ourselves. We do this by checking if the :attr:`Message.author`
   is the same as the :attr:`Client.user`.
5. Afterwards, we check if the :class:`Message.content` starts with ``'$hello'``. If it does,
   then we send a message in the channel it was used in with ``'Hello!'``. This is a basic way of
   handling commands, which can be later automated with the :doc:`./ext/commands/index` framework.
6. Finally, we run the bot with our login token. If you need help getting your token or creating a bot,
   look in the :ref:`discord-intro` section.


Now that we've made a bot, we have to *run* the bot. Luckily, this is simple since this is just a
Python script, we can run it directly.

On Windows:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ py -3 example_bot.py

On other systems:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ python3 example_bot.py

Now you can try playing around with your basic bot.
