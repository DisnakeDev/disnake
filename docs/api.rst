API Reference
===============

The following section outlines the API of disnake.

.. note::

    This module uses the Python logging module to log diagnostic and errors
    in an output independent way.  If the logging module is not configured,
    these logs will not be output anywhere.  See :ref:`logging_setup` for
    more information on how to set up and use the logging module with
    disnake.

Version Related Info
---------------------

There are two main ways to query version information about the library. For guarantees, check :ref:`version_guarantees`.

.. data:: version_info

    A named tuple that is similar to :obj:`py:sys.version_info`.

    Just like :obj:`py:sys.version_info` the valid values for ``releaselevel`` are
    'alpha', 'beta', 'candidate' and 'final'.

.. data:: __version__

    A string representation of the version. e.g. ``'1.0.0rc1'``. This is based
    off of :pep:`440`.

Event Reference
---------------

This section outlines the different types of events listened by :class:`Client`.

There are two ways to register an event, the first way is through the use of
:meth:`Client.event`. The second way is through subclassing :class:`Client` and
overriding the specific events. For example: ::

    import disnake

    class MyClient(disnake.Client):
        async def on_message(self, message):
            if message.author == self.user:
                return

            if message.content.startswith('$hello'):
                await message.channel.send('Hello World!')


If an event handler raises an exception, :func:`on_error` will be called
to handle it, which defaults to print a traceback and ignoring the exception.

.. warning::

    All the events must be a |coroutine_link|_. If they aren't, then you might get unexpected
    errors. In order to turn a function into a coroutine they must be ``async def``
    functions.

Client
~~~~~~

This section documents events related to :class:`Client` and its connectivity to Discord.

.. function:: on_connect()

    Called when the client has successfully connected to Discord. This is not
    the same as the client being fully prepared, see :func:`on_ready` for that.

    The warnings on :func:`on_ready` also apply.

.. function:: on_disconnect()

    Called when the client has disconnected from Discord, or a connection attempt to Discord has failed.
    This could happen either through the internet being disconnected, explicit calls to close,
    or Discord terminating the connection one way or the other.

    This function can be called many times without a corresponding :func:`on_connect` call.

.. function:: on_error(event, *args, **kwargs)

    Usually when an event raises an uncaught exception, a traceback is
    printed to stderr and the exception is ignored. If you want to
    change this behaviour and handle the exception for whatever reason
    yourself, this event can be overridden. Which, when done, will
    suppress the default action of printing the traceback.

    The information of the exception raised and the exception itself can
    be retrieved with a standard call to :func:`sys.exc_info`.

    If you want exception to propagate out of the :class:`Client` class
    you can define an ``on_error`` handler consisting of a single empty
    :ref:`raise statement <py:raise>`. Exceptions raised by ``on_error`` will not be
    handled in any way by :class:`Client`.

    .. note::

        ``on_error`` will only be dispatched to :meth:`Client.event`.

        It will not be received by :meth:`Client.wait_for`, or, if used,
        :ref:`ext_commands_api_bot` listeners such as
        :meth:`~ext.commands.Bot.listen` or :meth:`~ext.commands.Cog.listener`.

    :param event: The name of the event that raised the exception.
    :type event: :class:`str`

    :param args: The positional arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.
    :param kwargs: The keyword arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.

.. function:: on_gateway_error(event, data, shard_id, exc)

    When a (known) gateway event cannot be parsed, a traceback is printed to
    stderr and the exception is ignored by default. This should generally
    not happen and is usually either a library issue, or caused by a breaking API change.

    To change this behaviour, for example to completely stop the bot, this event can be overridden.

    This can also be disabled completely by passing ``enable_gateway_error_handler=False``
    to the client on initialization, restoring the pre-v2.6 behavior.

    .. versionadded:: 2.6

    .. note::
        ``on_gateway_error`` will only be dispatched to :meth:`Client.event`.

        It will not be received by :meth:`Client.wait_for`, or, if used,
        :ref:`ext_commands_api_bot` listeners such as
        :meth:`~ext.commands.Bot.listen` or :meth:`~ext.commands.Cog.listener`.

    .. note::
        This will not be dispatched for exceptions that occur while parsing ``READY`` and
        ``RESUMED`` event payloads, as exceptions in these events are considered fatal.

    :param event: The name of the gateway event that was the cause of the exception,
        for example ``MESSAGE_CREATE``.
    :type event: :class:`str`

    :param data: The raw event payload.
    :type data: :class:`Any`

    :param shard_id: The ID of the shard the exception occurred in, if applicable.
    :type shard_id: Optional[:class:`int`]

    :param exc: The exception that was raised.
    :type exc: :class:`Exception`

.. function:: on_ready()

    Called when the client is done preparing the data received from Discord. Usually after login is successful
    and the :attr:`Client.guilds` and co. are filled up.

    .. warning::

        This function is not guaranteed to be the first event called.
        Likewise, this function is **not** guaranteed to only be called
        once. This library implements reconnection logic and thus will
        end up calling this event whenever a RESUME request fails.

.. function:: on_resumed()

    Called when the client has resumed a session.

.. function:: on_shard_connect(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_connect` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has connected to Discord.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that has connected.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`

.. function:: on_shard_disconnect(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_disconnect` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has disconnected from Discord.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that has disconnected.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`

.. function:: on_shard_ready(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_ready` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has become ready.

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that is ready.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`

.. function:: on_shard_resumed(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_resumed` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has resumed a session.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that has resumed.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`

.. function:: on_socket_event_type(event_type)

    Called whenever a websocket event is received from the WebSocket.

    This is mainly useful for logging how many events you are receiving
    from the Discord gateway.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param event_type: The event type from Discord that is received, e.g. ``'READY'``.
    :type event_type: :class:`str`

.. function:: on_socket_raw_receive(msg)

    Called whenever a message is completely received from the WebSocket, before
    it's processed and parsed. This event is always dispatched when a
    complete message is received and the passed data is not parsed in any way.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    This requires setting the ``enable_debug_events`` setting in the :class:`Client`.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages received from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param msg: The message passed in from the WebSocket library.
    :type msg: :class:`str`

.. function:: on_socket_raw_send(payload)

    Called whenever a send operation is done on the WebSocket before the
    message is sent. The passed parameter is the message that is being
    sent to the WebSocket.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    This requires setting the ``enable_debug_events`` setting in the :class:`Client`.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages sent from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param payload: The message that is about to be passed on to the
                    WebSocket library. It can be :class:`bytes` to denote a binary
                    message or :class:`str` to denote a regular text message.

    .. note::
        This event will not be called for threads created by the bot or
        threads created on one of the bot's messages.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    .. versionchanged:: 2.5
        This is no longer being called when a thread is created, see :func:`on_thread_create` instead.

    :param member: The member who joined or left.
    :type member: :class:`ThreadMember`

.. function:: on_thread_remove(thread)

    Called whenever a thread is removed. This is different from a thread being deleted.

    Note that you can get the guild from :attr:`Thread.guild`.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    .. warning::

        Due to technical limitations, this event might not be called
        as soon as one expects. Since the library tracks thread membership
        locally, the API only sends updated thread membership status upon being
        synced by joining a thread.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param thread: The thread that got removed.
    :type thread: :class:`Thread`

.. function:: on_thread_update(before, after)

    Called when a thread is updated. If the thread is not found
    in the internal thread cache, then this event will not be called.
    Consider using :func:`on_raw_thread_update` which will be called regardless of the cache.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param before: The updated thread's old info.
    :type before: :class:`Thread`
    :param after: The updated thread's new info.
    :type after: :class:`Thread`

.. function:: on_thread_delete(thread)

    Called when a thread is deleted. If the thread is not found
    in the internal thread cache, then this event will not be called.
    Consider using :func:`on_raw_thread_delete` instead.

    Note that you can get the guild from :attr:`Thread.guild`.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param thread: The thread that got deleted.
    :type thread: :class:`Thread`

.. function:: on_raw_thread_member_remove(payload)

    Called when a :class:`ThreadMember` leaves :class:`Thread`.
    Unlike :func:`on_thread_member_remove`, this is called regardless of the thread member cache.

    You can get the thread a member belongs in by accessing :attr:`ThreadMember.thread`.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.members` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 2.5

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawThreadMemberRemoveEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_thread_update(after)

    Called whenever a thread is updated.

This section documents events related to application commands and other interactions.

.. function:: on_application_command(interaction)

    Called when an application command is invoked.

    .. warning::

        This is a low level function that is not generally meant to be used.
        Consider using :class:`~ext.commands.Bot` or :class:`~ext.commands.InteractionBot` instead.

    .. warning::

        If you decide to override this event and are using :class:`~disnake.ext.commands.Bot` or related types,
        make sure to call :func:`Bot.process_application_commands <disnake.ext.commands.Bot.process_application_commands>`
        to ensure that the application commands are processed.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param interaction: The interaction object.
    :type interaction: :class:`ApplicationCommandInteraction`

.. function:: on_application_command_autocomplete(interaction)

    Called when an application command autocomplete is called.

    .. warning::

        This is a low level function that is not generally meant to be used.
        Consider using :class:`~ext.commands.Bot` or :class:`~ext.commands.InteractionBot` instead.

    .. warning::
        If you decide to override this event and are using :class:`~disnake.ext.commands.Bot` or related types,

Messages
~~~~~~~~

This section documents events related to Discord chat messages.

.. function:: on_message(message)

    Called when a :class:`Message` is created and sent.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    .. warning::

        Your bot's own messages and private messages are sent through this
        event. This can lead cases of 'recursion' depending on how your bot was
        programmed. If you want the bot to not reply to itself, consider
        checking the user IDs. Note that :class:`~ext.commands.Bot` does not
        have this problem.

    .. note::

        Not all messages will have ``content``. This is a Discord limitation.
        See the docs of :attr:`Intents.message_content` for more information.

    :param message: The current message.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_message_delete(message)

    Called when a message is deleted. If the message is not found in the
    internal message cache, then this event will not be called.
    Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_delete` event instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    .. note::

        Not all messages will have ``content``. This is a Discord limitation.
        See the docs of :attr:`Intents.message_content` for more information.


    :param message: The deleted message.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_message_edit(before, after)

    Called when a :class:`Message` receives an update event. If the message is not found
    in the internal message cache, then these events will not be called.
    Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_edit` event instead.

    .. note::

        Not all messages will have ``content``. This is a Discord limitation.
        See the docs of :attr:`Intents.message_content` for more information.

    The following non-exhaustive cases trigger this event:

    - A message has been pinned or unpinned.
    - The message content has been changed.
    - The message has received an embed.

        - For performance reasons, the embed server does not do this in a "consistent" manner.

    - The message's embeds were suppressed or unsuppressed.
    - A call message has received an update to its participants or ending time.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param before: The previous version of the message.
    :type before: :class:`Message`
    :param after: The current version of the message.
    :type after: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_bulk_message_delete(messages)

    Called when messages are bulk deleted. If none of the messages deleted
    are found in the internal message cache, then this event will not be called.
    If individual messages were not found in the internal message cache,
    this event will still be called, but the messages not found will not be included in
    the messages list. Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_bulk_message_delete` event instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param messages: The messages that have been deleted.
    :type messages: List[:class:`Message`]

.. function:: on_raw_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a message is deleted. Unlike :func:`on_message_delete`, this is
    called regardless of the message being in the internal message cache or not.

    If the message is found in the message cache,
    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageDeleteEvent.cached_message`

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageDeleteEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_message_edit(payload)

    Called when a message is edited. Unlike :func:`on_message_edit`, this is called
    regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    If the message is found in the message cache,
    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message`. The cached message represents
    the message before it has been edited. For example, if the content of a message is modified and
    triggers the :func:`on_raw_message_edit` coroutine, the :attr:`RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message`
    will return a :class:`Message` object that represents the message before the content was modified.

    Due to the inherently raw nature of this event, the data parameter coincides with
    the raw data given by the :ddocs:`gateway <topics/gateway-events#message-update>`.

    Since the data payload can be partial, care must be taken when accessing stuff in the dictionary.
    One example of a common case of partial data is when the ``'content'`` key is inaccessible. This
    denotes an "embed" only edit, which is an edit in which only the embeds are updated by the Discord
    embed server.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageUpdateEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_bulk_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a bulk delete is triggered. Unlike :func:`on_bulk_message_delete`, this is
    called regardless of the messages being in the internal message cache or not.

    If the messages are found in the message cache,
    they can be accessed via :attr:`RawBulkMessageDeleteEvent.cached_messages`

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawBulkMessageDeleteEvent`

.. function:: on_reaction_add(reaction, user)

    Called when a message has a reaction added to it. Similar to :func:`on_message_edit`,
    if the message is not found in the internal message cache, then this
    event will not be called. Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_add` instead.

    .. note::

        To get the :class:`Message` being reacted, access it via :attr:`Reaction.message`.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.reactions` to be enabled.

    .. note::

        This doesn't require :attr:`Intents.members` within a guild context,
        but due to Discord not providing updated user information in a direct message
        it's required for direct messages to receive this event.
        Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_add` if you need this and do not otherwise want
        to enable the members intent.

    :param reaction: The current state of the reaction.
    :type reaction: :class:`Reaction`
    :param user: The user who added the reaction.
    :type user: Union[:class:`Member`, :class:`User`]

.. function:: on_reaction_remove(reaction, user)

    Called when a message has a reaction removed from it. Similar to on_message_edit,
    if the message is not found in the internal message cache, then this event
    will not be called.

    .. note::

        To get the message being reacted, access it via :attr:`Reaction.message`.

    This requires both :attr:`Intents.reactions` and :attr:`Intents.members` to be enabled.

    .. note::

        Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_remove` if you need this and do not want
        to enable the members intent.

    :param reaction: The current state of the reaction.
    :type reaction: :class:`Reaction`
    :param user: The user who added the reaction.
    :type user: Union[:class:`Member`, :class:`User`]

.. function:: on_reaction_clear(message, reactions)

    Called when a message has all its reactions removed from it. Similar to :func:`on_message_edit`,
    if the message is not found in the internal message cache, then this event
    will not be called. Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_clear` instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.reactions` to be enabled.

    :param message: The message that had its reactions cleared.
    :type message: :class:`Message`
    :param reactions: The reactions that were removed.
    :type reactions: List[:class:`Reaction`]

.. function:: on_reaction_clear_emoji(reaction)

    Called when a message has a specific reaction removed from it. Similar to :func:`on_message_edit`,
    if the message is not found in the internal message cache, then this event
    will not be called. Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_clear_emoji` instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.reactions` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

    :param reaction: The reaction that got cleared.
    :type reaction: :class:`Reaction`

.. function:: on_raw_reaction_add(payload)

    Called when a message has a reaction added. Unlike :func:`on_reaction_add`, this is
    called regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.reactions` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawReactionActionEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_reaction_remove(payload)

    Called when a message has a reaction removed. Unlike :func:`on_reaction_remove`, this is
    called regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.reactions` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawReactionActionEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_reaction_clear(payload)

    Called when a message has all its reactions removed. Unlike :func:`on_reaction_clear`,
    this is called regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.reactions` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawReactionClearEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_reaction_clear_emoji(payload)

    Called when a message has a specific reaction removed from it. Unlike :func:`on_reaction_clear_emoji` this is called
    regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.reactions` to be enabled.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawReactionClearEmojiEvent`

.. function:: on_typing(channel, user, when)

    Called when someone begins typing a message.

    The ``channel`` parameter can be a :class:`abc.Messageable` instance, or a :class:`ForumChannel`.
    If channel is an :class:`abc.Messageable` instance, it could be a :class:`TextChannel`, :class:`VoiceChannel`, :class:`GroupChannel`,
    or :class:`DMChannel`.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.5
        ``channel`` may be a type :class:`ForumChannel`

    If the ``channel`` is a :class:`TextChannel`, :class:`ForumChannel`, or :class:`VoiceChannel` then the
    ``user`` parameter is a :class:`Member`, otherwise it is a :class:`User`.

    If the ``channel`` is a :class:`DMChannel` and the user is not found in the internal user/member cache,
    then this event will not be called. Consider using :func:`on_raw_typing` instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.typing` and :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    .. note::

        This doesn't require :attr:`Intents.members` within a guild context,
        but due to Discord not providing updated user information in a direct message
        it's required for direct messages to receive this event, if the bot didn't explicitly
        open the DM channel in the same session (through :func:`User.create_dm`, :func:`Client.create_dm`,
        or indirectly by sending a message to the user).
        Consider using :func:`on_raw_typing` if you need this and do not otherwise want
        to enable the members intent.

    :param channel: The location where the typing originated from.
    :type channel: Union[:class:`abc.Messageable`, :class:`ForumChannel`]
    :param user: The user that started typing.
    :type user: Union[:class:`User`, :class:`Member`]
    :param when: When the typing started as an aware datetime in UTC.
    :type when: :class:`datetime.datetime`

.. function:: on_raw_typing(data)

    Called when someone begins typing a message.

    This is similar to :func:`on_typing` except that it is called regardless of
    whether :attr:`Intents.members` and :attr:`Intents.guilds` are enabled.

    :param data: The raw event payload data.
    :type data: :class:`RawTypingEvent`

Async Iterator
----------------

Some API functions return an "async iterator". An async iterator is something that is
capable of being used in an :ref:`async for statement <py:async for>`.

These async iterators can be used as follows: ::

    async for elem in channel.history():
        # do stuff with elem here

Certain utilities make working with async iterators easier, detailed below.

.. class:: AsyncIterator

    Represents the "AsyncIterator" concept. Note that no such class exists,
    it is purely abstract.

    .. container:: operations

        .. describe:: async for x in y

            Iterates over the contents of the async iterator.


    .. method:: next()
        :async:

        |coro|

        Advances the iterator by one, if possible. If no more items are found
        then this raises :exc:`NoMoreItems`.

    .. method:: get(**attrs)
        :async:

        |coro|

        Similar to :func:`utils.get` except run over the async iterator.

        Getting the last message by a user named 'Dave' or ``None``: ::

            msg = await channel.history().get(author__name='Dave')

    .. method:: find(predicate)
        :async:

        |coro|

        Similar to :func:`utils.find` except run over the async iterator.

        Unlike :func:`utils.find`\, the predicate provided can be a
        |coroutine_link|_.

        Getting the last audit log with a reason or ``None``: ::

            def predicate(event):
                return event.reason is not None

            event = await guild.audit_logs().find(predicate)

        :param predicate: The predicate to use. Could be a |coroutine_link|_.
        :return: The first element that returns ``True`` for the predicate or ``None``.

    .. method:: flatten()
        :async:

        |coro|

        Flattens the async iterator into a :class:`list` with all the elements.

        :return: A list of every element in the async iterator.
        :rtype: list

    .. method:: chunk(max_size)

        Collects items into chunks of up to a given maximum size.
        Another :class:`AsyncIterator` is returned which collects items into
        :class:`list`\s of a given size. The maximum chunk size must be a positive integer.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6

        Collecting groups of users: ::

        :param func: The function to call on every element. Could be a |coroutine_link|_.
        :rtype: :class:`AsyncIterator`

    .. method:: filter(predicate)

        This is similar to the built-in :func:`filter <py:filter>` function. Another
        :class:`AsyncIterator` is returned that filters over the original
        async iterator. This predicate can be a regular function or a |coroutine_link|_.

Audit Log Data
----------------

Working with :meth:`Guild.audit_logs` is a complicated process with a lot of machinery
involved. The library attempts to make it easy to use and friendly. In order to accomplish
this goal, it must make use of a couple of data classes that aid in this goal.

.. attributetable:: AuditLogDiff

.. class:: AuditLogDiff

    Represents an audit log "change" object. A change object has dynamic
    attributes that depend on the type of action being done. Certain actions
    map to certain attributes being set.

    will lead to an attribute error.

    To get a list of attributes that have been set, you can iterate over
    them. To see a list of all possible attributes that could be set based
    on the action being done, check the documentation for :class:`AuditLogAction`,

Abstract Base Classes
-----------------------

An :term:`abstract base class` (also known as an ``abc``) is a class that models can inherit
to get their behaviour. **Abstract base classes should not be instantiated**.
They are mainly there for usage with :func:`isinstance` and :func:`issubclass`\.

This library has a module related to abstract base classes, in which all the ABCs are subclasses of
:class:`typing.Protocol`.

Discord Models
---------------

Models are classes that are received from Discord and are not meant to be created by
the user of the library.

.. danger::

    The classes listed below are **not intended to be created by users** and are also
    **read-only**.

    For example, this means that you should not make your own :class:`User` instances
    nor should you modify the :class:`User` instance yourself.

    If you want to get one of these model classes instances they'd have to be through
    the cache, and a common way of doing so is through the :func:`utils.find` function
    or attributes of model classes that you receive from the events specified in the
    :ref:`discord-api-events`.

.. note::

    Nearly all classes here have :ref:`py:slots` defined which means that it is
    impossible to have dynamic attributes to the data classes.

Data Classes
--------------

Some classes are just there to be data containers, this lists them.

Unlike :ref:`models <discord_api_models>` you are allowed to create
most of these yourself, even if they can also be used to hold attributes.

Nearly all classes here have :ref:`py:slots` defined which means that it is
impossible to have dynamic attributes to the data classes.

The only exception to this rule is :class:`Object`, which is made with
dynamic attributes in mind.
