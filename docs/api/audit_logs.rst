Audit Logs
==========

Working with audit logs is a complicated process with a lot of machinery
involved. The library attempts to make this user-friendly by
making use of a couple of data classes and enums, listed below.

Data Classes
------------

AuditLogChanges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. attributetable:: AuditLogChanges

.. class:: AuditLogChanges

    An audit log change set.

    .. attribute:: before

        The old value. The attribute has the type of :class:`AuditLogDiff`.

        Depending on the :class:`AuditLogActionCategory` retrieved by
        :attr:`~AuditLogEntry.category`\, the data retrieved by this
        attribute differs:

    will lead to an attribute error.

    To get a list of attributes that have been set, you can iterate over
    them. To see a list of all possible attributes that could be set based
    on the action being done, check the documentation for :class:`AuditLogAction`,
    otherwise check the documentation below for all attributes that are possible.
