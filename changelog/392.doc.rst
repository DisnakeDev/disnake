Split up documentation into multiple files.
- Main ``disnake`` API reference is now under ``api/``.
- ``disnake.ext.commands`` API reference is now under ``ext/commands/api/``.
- ``disnake.ext.tasks`` is considered small enough to leave it as-is, and is not changed.
- Legacy ``api.html`` and ``ext/commands/api.html`` pages are deprecated and exist only to serve as redirects.
- - Links with pre-existing anchors will be redirected to their appropriate page.
