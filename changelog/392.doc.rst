Split the monolithic API Reference pages into multiple sub-references.
- Main ``disnake`` API reference can now be found at :doc:`API Reference <api/index>`.
- ``disnake.ext.commands`` API reference is now under :doc:`Commands API Reference <ext/commands/api/index>`.
- Legacy ``api.html`` and ``ext/commands/api.html`` pages are deprecated.
- - Links with pre-existing references (eg ``/api.html#disnake.AppInfo``) will be redirected to their appropriate page.
