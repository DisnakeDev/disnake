Rework :class:`.Embed` internals.
- :meth:`Embed.set_footer` now requires the ``text`` parameter.
- :attr:`Embed.type` is now optional, although this could previously be ``Embed.Empty``.
- ``EmptyEmbed`` and ``Embed.Empty`` are deprecated in favor of ``None``, have been removed from the documentation, and will result in type-checking errors.
