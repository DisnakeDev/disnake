Add support for new components in :class:`~ui.Modal`\s.
- Add new top-level :class:`ui.Label` component, which wraps other components (currently :class:`~ui.TextInput` and :class:`~ui.StringSelect`) in a modal with a label and description.
- Using :class:`ActionRow`\s in modals (or plain :class:`TextInput`\s, which implicitly get wrapped in action rows) is now deprecated in favor of :class:`ui.Label`.
- :class:`ui.StringSelect` can now be used in modals when placed inside a :class:`ui.Label`.
    - The new modal-specific :attr:`ui.StringSelect.required` field can be used to make a select menu optional.
