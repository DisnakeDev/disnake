:attr:`enum.PartyType` is obsolete.

The PartyType enum contains IDs of voice activities, which aren't documented in any official capacity. New activities get added/removed constantly, so keeping up with maintaining that list is rather difficult.

Since the introduction of this enum, activities have been released officially.
If anything, providing activities should really be more of a bot's responsibility, not the library's, so we should consider deprecating and removing this enum.
