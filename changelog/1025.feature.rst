Add support for new username system - see the official `help article <https://dis.gd/app-usernames>`__ for details. Existing functionality is kept backwards-compatible while the migration is still ongoing.
- Add :attr:`User.global_name`, and update attributes/methods to account for it:
    - :attr:`User.display_name` and :attr:`Member.display_name`
    - :meth:`Guild.get_member_named`
    - |commands| :class:`~ext.commands.UserConverter` and :class:`~ext.commands.MemberConverter`, now largely matching the behavior of :meth:`Guild.get_member_named`
- Update ``str(user)`` and ``str(member)`` to not include ``#0`` discriminator of migrated users.
- Adjust :attr:`User.default_avatar` to account for new default avatar handling.
