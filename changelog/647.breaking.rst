:attr:`Interaction.guild` is now an unavailable guild instance if the guild could not be found in cache.

Importantly, this affects code which used ``inter.guild`` as a logic gate. A simple solution to this is to now use :attr:`Interaction.guild_id` instead.
To know whether or not the bot is in the guild, check if the guild is present in the client's guild cache.
If the cache is not enabled, checking if the bot is in the guild can be attempted by fetching the guild, but this is not recommended due to ratelimits.
