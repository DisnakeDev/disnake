Add multiple converters for previously undocumented fields for audit logs.

:class:`AuditLogDiff` can now have the following attributes with the specified types:

- :attr:`~AuditLogDiff.flags` --- :class:`ChannelFlags`
- :attr:`~AuditLogDiff.system_channel_flags` --- :class:`SystemChannelFlags`

``AuditLogDiff.unicode_emoji``, used for role icons, was renamed to :attr:`AuditLogDiff.emoji`.
