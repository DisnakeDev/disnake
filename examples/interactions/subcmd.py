# Slash command subcommands differ from classic text subcommands & groups.
#
# The gist of it is:
#   - Any slash command which takes no arguments can be considered a parent.
#   - A parent has children, which are subcommands or subcommand groups
#   - Groups have subcommand children themselves
#
# Parent slash commands and groups cannot be invoked by users directly,
# but their callback will be invoked before any of their children are called.
#
# For a full explanation, see https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#subcommands-and-subcommand-groups


# Define a new command with two children:
@bot.slash_command()
async def parent(inter):
    print("This code is ran every time any subcommand is invoked")


@parent.sub_command()
async def foo(inter, option: str):
    await inter.response.send_message(f"foo: {option}")


@parent.sub_command()
async def bar(inter, option: int):
    await inter.response.send_message(f"bar: {option}")


# Define a new command with sub command groups (this time in a cog).
# This results in two commands that can be called:
#   - /command foo a
#   - /command bar b
# Note that `/command`, `/command foo`, or `/command bar` cannot be
# called directly by users.
